StrangeCtrl
===========

A very strange control for your desktop as it simulates mouse and keyboard input.

Why?
====

* You got a gamepad (an XBOX controller for example) and an old game not recognizing it
* Due to some reason, you are not capable of using a keyboard and/or a mouse

Quickstart
==========

Just configure it like this (see config.xml), for example:
"
	<!-- Left mouse click -->
	<entry key="Button 0">mouseClick 1</entry>

	<!-- Keyboard: open and close tab -->
	<entry key="Button 1">keyCombo CONTROL T</entry>
	<entry key="Button 2">keyCombo CONTROL W</entry>
"
and start it.

Now you are able to quickly open and close tabs in your favourite browser or whatever application you want help at.
