StrangeCtrl
===========

A very strange control for your desktop as it simulates mouse and keyboard input.

Why?
====

* You got a gamepad (an XBOX controller for example) and an old game not recognizing it
* Due to some reason, you are not capable of using a keyboard and/or a mouse

Quickstart
==========
Just run program and plug in your controller. If you need more help look to Wiki or PM me (magx2)


Configuring keys
================================
